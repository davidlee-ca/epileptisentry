# About
An estimated 20% of epilepsy diagnosis are estimated to be wrong, given that as many as 1% of Americans are diagnosed with it. Electroencephalogram, or EEG, enables us to visualize brain activity and understand the nature of epileptic seizures, but they need to be processed first -- and theyâ€™re too computationally heavy for edge devices. especially nowadays when EEG readings tend to be taken at home in an outpatient setting. Worse, these events are rare in occurrence and short in duration, so monitoring patients 1-on-1 for extended periods of time is too labor- and cost-intensive to be practical. Having computers identify seizure features in the EEG signals and alerting someone to capture the details of the seizure event as they happen would be very helpful.
